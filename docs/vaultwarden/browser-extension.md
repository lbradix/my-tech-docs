# Using the Vaultwarden Browser Extension

Vaultwarden works seamlessly with the official Bitwarden browser extension. This allows you to quickly fill in passwords, save new logins, and access your vault without opening the full web app.

## Step 1: Install the Browser Extension

Choose your browser and install the Bitwarden extension:

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitwarden-free-password-ma/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/)
- [Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/bitwarden-password-manage/jbkfoedolllekgbhcbcoahefnbanhhlh)

## Step 2: Log Into the Extension

1. Click the extension icon.
2. On the login screen, click **Settings**.
3. Under **Server URL**, replace the default with your self-hosted Vaultwarden address (e.g., `https://vault.bradix.org`).
4. Go back and log in with your email and master password.

!!! warning "If you don't change the Server URL, the extension will try to connect to Bitwarden's cloud servers instead of your Vaultwarden instance."
