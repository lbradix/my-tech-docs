# Vaultwarden Best Practices

Using a password manager is one of the best steps you can take to improve your online security. Here are some recommended practices to help you get the most out of Vaultwarden.

---

## Use a Strong Master Password

- Choose a **long passphrase** (e.g., a sentence with random words).
- Avoid using personal details or reused passwords.
- Store your master password in a secure, offline location (e.g., a physical notebook or password-protected file).

!!! note "Remember: Your master password cannot be recovered. If you forget it, your vault is permanently inaccessible."

---

## Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

- Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy.
- Enable 2FA as soon as possible under **Account Settings &rarr; Security &rarr; Two-Step Login**.
- Save backup codes in a secure location.

!!! note "2FA adds a critical layer of protection, especially if your email is compromised."

## Keep Your Vault Organized

- Use **folders** to group related items (e.g., “Work,” “Finance,” “Personal”).
- Name entries clearly (e.g., “Gmail - Personal” vs. “Gmail - Work”).
- Use **favorites** ☆ for logins you use daily.

---

## Clean Up Regularly

- Delete unused or duplicate items.
- Review shared items to make sure access is still appropriate.
- Reorganize your vault if it starts to feel cluttered.

---

## Update Passwords Often

- Rotate passwords for high-value accounts (e.g., email, banking).
- If you hear about a breach, change that account’s password immediately.
- Use the **password generator** when creating new accounts.

---

## Be Cautious with Shared Items

- Only share what’s **necessary**.
- Use **Collections** in Organizations to restrict access.
- Never share your **master password** or 2FA codes.

---

## Log Out on Shared Devices

- Always log out of the browser extension and web app when using a public or shared computer.
- Consider using **Incognito Mode** or a private browser session for extra safety.
