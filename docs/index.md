# Welcome

Hello! I'm LeValle Bradix and welcome to my technical writing portfolio! I'm excited to share the work I've created while learning and growing as a technical communicator. This site showcases my documentation projects, tutorials, and hands-on guides aimed at simplifying complex tools and technologies.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Step-by-step tutorials** for tools like MkDocs, GitHub, and more
- **Documentation samples** from real-world scenarios and self-driven projects

## About Me

I transitioned into technical writing from a background in IT and system administration. With a passion for clear communication and user empowerment, I focus on making technical topics easier to understand and apply. I'm especially interested in documentation for open-source tools, system setups, and developer resources.
