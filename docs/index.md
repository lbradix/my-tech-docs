# Welcome

Hello! I'm LeValle Bradix and welcome to my technical writing portfolio! I'm excited to share the work I've created while learning and growing as a technical author. My MkDocs site  features clear, approachable documentation projects, tutorials, and hands-on guides for various complex tools and technologies.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Step-by-step tutorials** for tools like MkDocs, GitHub, and more
- **Documentation samples** from real-world scenarios and self-driven projects
- **Writing style that emphasizes clarity, structure, and accessibility**

## About Me

I transitioned into technical writing from a background in IT, system administration and years of customer service. Having a constant drive to learn and improve, I bring that same curiosity and empathy into my documentation.  I'm particularly interested in creating documentation for open-source tools, system setups, and home lab resources.
